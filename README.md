<h2 id="what-is-chest-disease-detection">What is Chest Disease Detection by X-ray? 🤔</h2>

Chest disease detection by X-ray utilizes deep learning models to analyze chest X-ray images for diagnosing conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this became a vital tool, as X-rays provided quick, non-invasive diagnostics. This project focuses on developing a web-based application that allows users to upload X-rays and receive predictions about their lung health, thereby reducing hospital visits and assisting healthcare professionals with quicker diagnoses. The goal is to help both patients and doctors understand whether a person has a respiratory disease, such as:

- **Normal**: No disease. ✅
- **Pneumonia-Bacterial**: Bacterial infection in the lungs. 🦠  
- **Pneumonia-Viral**: Viral infection causing lung inflammation. 🤒  
- **Tuberculosis**: A bacterial infection affecting the lungs. 🏥  
- **Lung Opacity**: Other lung conditions detectable via X-rays. 🌫️  
- **COVID-19**: Viral infection primarily affecting the respiratory system. 🦠🌍

---

 <h2 id="datasets-used">Datasets Used in This Project 📊</h2>

<h2 id="why-use-xrays">Why We Use X-rays Instead of PCR? 💡</h2>

X-rays provide a non-invasive, quick, and widely available method for diagnosing lung diseases. While PCR tests are commonly used for detecting viral infections like COVID-19, they do not provide information about the state of the lungs. X-rays, on the other hand, allow medical professionals to visualize lung damage or inflammation, which can indicate diseases such as pneumonia or COVID-19. This helps in a broader diagnosis, especially for conditions that PCR cannot detect.

<h2 id="visualization">Visualization 📊</h2>

**What is Visualization?** 🖼️  
Visualization in the context of machine learning refers to the graphical representation of data, model performance, or results. It can involve plotting data distributions, learning curves, confusion matrices, Grad-CAM heatmaps, or other metrics to help interpret how a model is behaving and to explore the underlying dataset.

**Why We Use Visualization:** 🔍  
- **Understanding Data**: Visualization helps in identifying patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the dataset. For example, plotting class distributions can reveal imbalances, and scatter plots can help understand relationships between variables.
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: We use visualization to interpret how well the model is learning, using tools like accuracy and loss plots, confusion matrices, and ROC curves to observe model progress over epochs.
- **Debugging**: Visualization can highlight where the model might be going wrong. For example, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) heatmaps can show which parts of an image the model focused on when making a decision, helping us understand and interpret predictions.
- **Communicating Results**: Visualizations make it easier to communicate results to stakeholders, especially non-technical individuals, by providing a clear and concise way to understand the model's output and its reliability.

<h2 id="imbalanced-data">Imbalanced Data ⚖️</h2>
This imbalance can cause challenges when training machine learning models, as models may become biased toward the majority class. They might achieve high overall accuracy by primarily predicting the majority class while failing to effectively recognize the minority class. This can lead to poor performance, especially for applications where the minority class is of significant interest, such as in medical diagnoses or fraud detection.


 <h2 id="class-distribution">Class Distribution 📊</h2>
Here’s the distribution of images across different classes, sorted in descending order by the number of images:

| Class                     | Number of Images | Percentage (%) |
|---------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Normal                    | 6500             | 25.1           |
| Lung Opacity              | 6012             | 23.2           |
| COVID-19                  | 4897             | 18.9           |
| Pneumonia-Bacterial       | 3001             | 11.6           |
| Pneumonia-Viral           | 3001             | 11.6           |
| Tuberculosis              | 2494             | 9.6            |
| **Total**                 | **25905**        | **100.0**      |

As we will see in the next figure:

<h2 id="imbalanced-data-impact">Imbalanced Data Can Affect Our Model ⚖️</h2>

Imbalanced data can cause several issues in model performance:

- **Poor Generalization**: The model may struggle to recognize the minority class effectively, leading to high accuracy but poor recall for that class.
- **Overfitting**: The model may focus on the majority class and fail to generalize well to the minority class, resulting in overfitting.
- **Bias**: Predictions may be biased toward the majority class, which can lead to incorrect conclusions, especially in critical applications like medical diagnostics.

 <h2 id="structure-of-datasets">Structure of the Datasets 📂</h2>

Each dataset follows the typical data structure for deep learning tasks:

- **Training Set**: 🏋️‍♂️ This set is used to train the model and constitutes about 70-80% of the dataset.
- **Validation Set**: 🔧 This is 10-20% of the dataset and is used to fine-tune model hyperparameters during training to avoid overfitting.
- **Test Set**: 🧪 This set, around 10-20% of the dataset, is used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.

<h2 id="solving-data-imbalance">Solving Data Imbalance Using Augmentation 🌱</h2>

Imbalanced data is a common issue in machine learning, particularly in medical imaging datasets. To address this, **data augmentation** is an effective approach.

#### **What is Data Augmentation?**  
Data augmentation involves creating additional training data from the existing dataset by applying transformations to original images. This technique helps balance the dataset by artificially increasing the number of samples in underrepresented classes.

#### **Why Use Augmentation for Imbalanced Data?**  
- **Increasing Diversity**: Introduces variability in the dataset, allowing the model to generalize better.
- **Balancing Class Distribution**: Augmenting only the minority classes creates a more balanced dataset without the need for additional real-world data.
- **Improving Model Robustness**: Augmented images make the model more resilient to variations like rotations, flips, and other distortions, enhancing performance on unseen data.

### **Common Augmentation Techniques**  
Here are some commonly used techniques to handle data imbalance:

1. **Rotation**: Rotating images by small angles to create new perspectives.
2. **Zooming**: Randomly zooming into images to simulate different scales.
3. **Shifting**: Translating images along the x or y axis.
   ```python
   from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
   
   train_gen = ImageDataGenerator(
       rescale=1. / 255,
       zoom_range=0.1,
       width_shift_range=0.1,
       height_shift_range=0.1,
       rotation_range=10,
       fill_mode='nearest'
   )
   test_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1. / 255)
   val_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1. / 255)
